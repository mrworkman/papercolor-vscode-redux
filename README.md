A _light_ colour theme for [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), based on
the fabulous [PaperColor theme](https://github.com/NLKNguyen/papercolor-theme)
for [vim](https://www.vim.org/). 

Note that there are of course differences between this theme and the one for
vim, mostly due to which textmate scopes have been defined for each language
(some things aren't easily doable).

The font shown in the screenshot is [Fira Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Mono) ([Info](https://mozilla.github.io/Fira/), [GitHub](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira)).

languages as well, but it may be incomplete or inconsistent with other
languages.

various languages.
