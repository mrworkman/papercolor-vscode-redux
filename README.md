# PaperColor-Redux Theme for VS Code

A semi-reasonable attempt at porting the VIM theme [PaperColor](https://github.com/NLKNguyen/papercolor-theme) to VS Code.

The font shown in the screenshot is [Fira Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Mono) (Githib: [Info](https://mozilla.github.io/Fira/), [Repo](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira)).

**This theme is still very much a work in progress, so feedback is appreciated!**

## Notes
1. I've been using the awesome [papercolor-vscode](https://github.com/rozbo/papercolor-vscode) theme for quite some time now, but it hasn't seen updates in awhile, and uses an XML-based textmate theme which is a bit of a pain to work with (IMO). Plus, I wanted to make a number of changes without changing the other project.
1. I used the [Cobalt2 Theme](https://github.com/wesbos/cobalt2-vscode) json theme file as the basis for this one.
1. This theme has nothing to do with the [Redux JavaScript Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redux_(JavaScript_library)).
